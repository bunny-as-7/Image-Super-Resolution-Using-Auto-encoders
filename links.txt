Course Objectives:

In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

Understand what autoencoders are and why they are used
Design and train an autoencoder to increase the resolution of images with Keras
By the end of this course, you will be able to design and build an autoencoder neural network to create high-resolution images from low-resolution source images.


============================


Task 1: Project Overview and Import Libraries
Task 2: What are Autoencoders?
Task 3: Build the Encoder
Task 4: Build the Decoder to Complete the Network
Task 5: Create Dataset and Specify Training Routine
Task 6: Load the Dataset and Pre-trained Model
Task 7: Model Predictions and Visualizing the Results
